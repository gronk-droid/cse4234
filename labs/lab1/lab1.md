    1. **I started this web site because Christmas has always been my favorite holiday. Last year, I started selling some of my favorite Christmas products and they've become quite a hit.**
    2. **If you click on the personal link, you can browse my favorite Christmas pictures, stories and films. If you join my email list, I will keep you you up-to-date on all things Christmas.**

  7. Emphasize using the appropriate tag ' **No questions asked!**'
  8. Add an address for your store. After the address, add a link to **Google Maps** so the user can get directions.
